# Hangman
Hangman is a program to play the famous guessing game (you might have guessed it) "hangman". 

This program uses 2 classes:
- HangmanGame: This is where the GUI and overall game is stored and ran, this is also where the wordbank data is stored and pulled from.
- Scoreboard: This adds an extra part of the GUI to display and record wins/losses.

In this way we are able to play hangman in a provided GUI from JavaFX.
